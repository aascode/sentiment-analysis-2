# **Sentiment Analyzer**

## **Categories distribution**

Words play a central role in language and thought.
There are three main dimensions of word meaning shown by analysis studies:

- **Valence:** postive / negative or pleasure / displesure
- **Arousal:** excited / calm or active / passive
- **Dominance:** powerful / weak or have control / no have control

As represented as dimensions:

- **x** --> Valence
- **Y** --> Arousal
- **Z** --> Dominance

Through these three-dimensional categories was compared the **Wheel of emotions** by Robert Plutchik.
To later be resolved with the categories that were previously deliberated by Sidejar Â©.
In this way, a better distribution was achieved at the time of preprocessing the data, where certain categories are merely
redirected to the Speech Recognition stage.
